		<h2> WHAT WE DO... </h2>
		<br><br>
		<p>  Three point five is a website that is based on the theory that there are six degrees of separation 
between every human. In a recent Facebook study they found that there were only 3.5 degrees 
of separation between Facebook users. 

This is how i came up with the name for this project. I decided to use 3.5 instead of 6 as 
Facebook’s study (https://research.fb.com/three-and-a-half-degrees-of-separation/) which 
used a specifically designed algorithm and a data set of over 1.5 billion active users found that 
the concept of six degrees is now only 3.5 degrees in modern society.

In this website you can see how many degrees separate you and your favourite celebrity, just 
by entering your facebook username and your favourite celebrity’s name (from popstar to 
sports star). From there we will calculate how many degrees of separation there are between 
you and your chosen celebrity.

With this techonolgy we are hoping to create a way of finding out if someone is related to you 
or not, so keep an eye out for that in the near future! </p>
